        <h3>My Web development</h3>
        <p>
            So my first web development is actually this class. I had not used HTML,Css, or Js at all in my past and this would be my first time. I did however last hackathon attempted a project that used HTMl, CSS and JS;however, this was when I had no idea on how to use them as well they needed to call API and I had no idea how to do that.

            <h1> My Database Experances </h1>
            <p>
                I took the class database in 2109 last semster for the fall. I rally enjoyed that class since It seem simple enough while also having nuance in it. For database, I hope to potenally find a carrer in database mangment.

            <h2> My database for Cars </h2>
            <p> For this datbase, I am using a Json and it will look something like this.</p>
            <p> Computer Id = 1 PK INT</p>
            <p> GPU="Gpu4" Varchar</p>
            <p> CPU="CPU4" VarChar</p>
            <p> Motherboard="ddr3" Varchar </p>
            <p> Price = 1000$ INT </p>
            <p> Sales Date = 12/25/2023 Date</p>
            <p> Custmer Id= "1" int FK</p>
            <h1> Another Input</h1>
            <p> Computer Id = 5 PK INT</p>
            <p> GPU="Gpu10" Varchar</p>
            <p> CPU="CPU3" VarChar</p>
            <p> Motherboard="ddr3" Varchar </p>
            <p> Price = 1500$ INT </p>
            <p> Sales Date = 01/01/2024 Date</p>
            <p> Custmer Id= "44" int FK</p>

        <div class='homework'>
            <h1> My thoughts on the Homework.</h1>
            <p> I thought that the lab look intimnating at first but as i continued to  look at it, it was somewhat eaier but this is still more difficult than the first homework.   </p>
        </div>

        <div class='dbExp'>
            What I found hard about the home page is the react and just learning what react is. Another thing that is hard is usinga inject function with JS int order to create theHTMl page. I guess what I found easy is when I had this document, I knew what to do.
        </div>
        <div class='dbCar'>
            <h2>Thoughts on homework 1</h2>
            <p>What I thought about homework one is that I thought that for the mostpart, just writting paragraphs on what our website is going to be on to be easy. What I did find slightly harder is when I had to use a flex boxes. I wanted to put two images next to one another to make the website look prettier.</p>

        <div class = 'dbCar'>
    <h1> My thoughts on the Slide Show.</h1>
    I  found that react with the Ajax was much easier than using plain java script. It was a little confusing at first but I got the hang of it once I knew what to call and once I actually tried doing it. Before trying and just looking at the homework, I was very intimnated by how would i do it, but once I just took a breath and tried, it was more clear.
    Here is some of the Json files that I created.
    </div>
   
    <a href="json/Computer.json" target="_blank">Computer Json</a> 
    <p><a href="json/AnotherComputer.json" target="_blank">Another Computer Json</a> </p>

    </div>
